I understood the introduction, but everything following could use some clear explanations.",The assumptions were not explicitly stated. I would suggest explaining why this idea would work.,"I am unsure, as I could not find text explaining the thought process behind all the code. Code in itself is not as informative as straightforward explaining, especially in a research paper.",The beginning was well-motivated but I had a little trouble following through the rest of the paper. I did not notice a lot of definitions that would explain the concepts used. I feel like this paper needs more text.,"I like that the authors are going above and beyond just using networks to actually using those results in machine learning. Overall, this is a great idea, and seems to be executed well.","I would suggest removing the code (as much as possible) and writing in text what the code does. This would make the paper easier to follow. I would also suggest explaining what is depicted in the figures better. This would also reduce the number of pages in the paper, which, at the moment, is quite big.

Good job! Hope this helps."

A lot of it is very hand-wavy and vague, and the graphs themselves don't convey a whole lot without analysis that details what is significant about the data.","I believe using similarity measures to do this makes a lot of sense. However, there is no explanation on WHY similarity measures is a good way to build a recommender system. It may be obvious to us since we just learned it, but it is still important to explain the concept and directly tie it into how it can better inform the machine learning system.","I understood the basic structure and flow. However, the regurgitation of all the visualizations and data is superfluous in my opinion; maybe you can selectively show the most significant data. Also, I suggest using pseudocode instead of the screenshots of all the Python. ",The concept is extremely interesting and makes a lot of sense. ,Just fleshing out all the explanations and the analysis.

As our readers are not very interested in all of the code work, putting too many pieces of code will disturb our flow, and we may not be able to catch the point of the authors. I think more words should be written to combine with the figures. Also, I would like to suggest the authors to shorten the their results (summarize the core part)."

Once it is filtered through and ordered and explained it will be more clear.,There is a lot of data. 53 pages of data almost is very impressive. I am sure that there are strong conclusions and techniques being used here but the way it is currently structured I have no idea what it is.,Have a strong introduction and explain clearly what the goal of the paper is in detail. Include less code and explain what every bit of code and graphs included actually does.

This seems to be an interesting model, and I'm looking forward to hearing more about how it was developed.",There wasn't much writing so I had to assign low scores for a lot of the rubric. Just make sure to state your assumptions and explain why you made certain decisions when creating the model. It might be interesting to see if this algorithm works in other social network datasets.,"The intro at the beginning was a good overview of how you are basing the algorithm off of similarity measures. I don't know much about machine learning, so it was hard for me to understand the code without some commentary. It seems like a great recommender system though!","Just based on your headings it looks like there will be a good flow, but make sure to define all of you terms and explain how you trained the model. Also, add discussion for the and variables you used.","The visuals were well-chosen, just make sure to weave them throughout your paper/presentation with some context. The recommender system appears to work well which is a big accomplishment!","Be sure to explain the machine learning techniques in a way that someone unfamiliar with it would still be able to understand the heart of your paper. Looks like you have the modeling down, just need to add some writing :)"
